### Legend:
- (*) - Completely free resource
- (**) - Completely free resurce when registering with *@my.utsa.edu account
- (***) - Resource with some free content but contains student subscription plans at a significant discount (must make an account with *@my.utsa.edu email)

### Notes:
- (1) - Hack The Box Academy contains a student subscription plan that only costs 8 dollars a month when you sign up with your UTSA email. The plan gives you access to all modules tier II and below. This plan also gives you full access to the Penetration Tester, Bug Bounty Hunter, and SOC Analyst job role paths, which are the training material for the CPTS, CBBH, and CDSA certifications respectively. This is an amazing deal, trust me.
- (2) - O'RIELLY is a publishing company that publishes many wonderful textbooks in many fields relating to IT. Of particular note are their complete exam guides for all of the CompTIA certifications.
- (3) - I want to give special attention to this resource because the content is absolutely amazing and very beginner friendly, and the labs are extremely valuable. If you are interested in web penetration testing, please please please use this resource.
- (4) - This resource is exclusively dedicated to teaching malware development for x64 CPU architectures, and particularly for the Windows operating system.
- (5) - While this is listed as a CTF platform, it is primarily for teaching bug bounty hunting on web applications.
- (6) - This is a platform that aggregates CTF competitions hosted by various individuals or organizations. You can compete individually or with a team. There are some people that really take this seriously so don't be discouraged if you have a hard time at first.
- (7) - This is an overview of various certifications and the disciplines that they fall under. This is not meant to be a guide or a path of certifications to get.
- (8) - These certifications are notoriously difficult and very new. They are still developing their reputation but if you complete one, you will be very competent in whatever you studied.
- (9) - OffSec is currently the head honcho of offensive security certifications, specifically OSCP, but they are very expensive. Their certifications are very well recognized.
- (10) - CompTIA has a variety of certifications but you should consider going for Security+ first, as that is a baseline certification that most employers expect and desire. I am also of the opinion that you should make your way through the training for the Linux+ certification. Please remember that all of the exam study guides can be found FOR FREE through O'RIELLY.
